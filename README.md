MineSweeper is a console and web based application.

To launch MineSweeper run the solution in the folder. I have used rider, which makes it easy. Also VS Studio can be used I guess. Dotnet Core 3.1.1 needed. 

CHECK NUGET PACKAGES and update to necessary ones!

BookApp is a EF Core and CRUD pages scaffolding demo, nothing special.
